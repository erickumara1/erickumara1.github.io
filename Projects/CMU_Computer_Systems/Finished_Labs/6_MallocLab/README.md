# Lab6 Malloc Lab

The original tar file is `malloclab-handout.tar` and the writeup is `malloclab.pdf`. The implicit list solution is in `./malloclab-implicit`, the explicit list solution is in `./malloclab-explicit`.

### Before starting 
Read `9.9` of `CSAPP: 3e` very carefully, make sure you understand each line of code.   

As indicated in the handout and the lecture, this could be the hardest among all labs. Be prepared.


### Implicit List Solution
Read through the code in `CSAPP: 3e` `9.9` (which could also be found at `./vm/malloc/`), make sure you totally understand the code. Then you easily get the solution for the implicit list.
